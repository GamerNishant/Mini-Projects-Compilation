html :
disabled It generally disables the click from the selected class

css:
display : mainly have 6 types

        basic ones:
        none = as if the element is completely removed from the space.
        inline: tries to minimize the space to wrap the contents and allows another content from it's ending position.
        block : complete cover the entire width alloted to it. It inserts a newline above and below it.
        inline-block: acts as inline but allows you to set width and height as well for the property.

        complex:
        flexbox : I will gain complete info on it.
